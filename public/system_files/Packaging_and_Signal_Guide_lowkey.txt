PACKAGING PHILOSOPHY: BROADCAST NEWS STANDARDS
Our goal is to be a credible space news source. We report, not sensationalize.

TITLE LOGIC: BROADCAST NEWS FORMAT
Every title should read like an AP/Reuters news wire headline.
- NO: "Elon's Secret Project Revealed" (Clickbait)
- NO: "SpaceX Raptor 3: The End of Internal Plumbing?" (Too technical)
- YES: "SpaceX Tests New Raptor 3 Engine Design" (News headline)

TITLE FORMULA: [Subject] + [Action/Outcome]
- Active voice, present tense for recent events
- Third-person, objective perspective
- Lead with the company/agency name

Examples:
- "SpaceX Successfully Tests Raptor 3 Engine"
- "NASA Confirms Artemis III Launch Delay to 2026"
- "China Unveils Long March 9 Rocket Program"
- "Boeing Starliner Returns Without Crew"
- "Blue Origin Launches First New Glenn Rocket"

THUMBNAIL TEXT HIERARCHY:
We use a two-tier text system that signals NEWS, not drama.

1. PRIMARY TEXT (The News Hook):
   - Focus: What type of news is this?
   - Style: Largest font, bold, high contrast.
   - Constraint: Max 2 words. (e.g., "BREAKING", "LAUNCH DAY", "TEST FLIGHT", "DELAYED").

2. SECONDARY TEXT (The Subject):
   - Focus: Who and what outcome.
   - Style: Smaller, clean sans-serif.
   - Constraint: Max 3-4 words. (e.g., "SPACEX SUCCEEDS", "NASA PUSHES BACK", "FIRST FLIGHT").

VISUAL BALANCE:
Primary text signals the NEWS TYPE. Secondary text identifies the SUBJECT and OUTCOME. Clean and professional.

THE CREDIBILITY TEST:
If a viewer sees our title in their feed, they should think: "This looks like a legitimate news source covering space."
