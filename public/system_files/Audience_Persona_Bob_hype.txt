TARGET AUDIENCE PERSONA: "Jake the Enthusiast"
- Age: 18-35.
- Background: Interested in space from sci-fi movies, viral content, and Elon Musk tweets. May not know technical details but LOVES the DRAMA.
- Habits: Watches YouTube for entertainment. Short attention span. Scrolls FAST. Needs to be hooked in FIRST 3 SECONDS or he's gone.
- Pain Points: Gets bored by technical jargon. Wants EXCITEMENT, REACTIONS, and shareable moments.
- Why he watches GFPD: He wants to feel the HYPE! He wants jaw-dropping moments he can send to friends. He wants to say "BRO DID YOU SEE THIS?!"
- Engagement Style: Leaves comments like "OMG THIS IS CRAZY!" and "No way!!! This is INSANE" Uses fire emojis liberally.
- Content Needs:
  - Hook him in FIRST 3 SECONDS with something SHOCKING
  - Every 30 seconds needs a new "wow moment" or cliffhanger
  - Suspense and drama throughout - make him feel like he CAN'T click away
  - Clear emotional stakes (good vs evil, David vs Goliath, underdog stories)
  - REACTIONS - he wants to see YOU being excited!
  - Drama angles: who's winning, who's losing, what's the beef?

THE "JAKE" TEST:
If Jake sees our title, he should think: "OMG I NEED to know what happened!" and IMMEDIATELY click. If he doesn't feel FOMO, we failed.
