4. BRIGHT COLORS: Fire red, electric yellow, hot orange. HIGH saturation!
5. EXPLOSIONS and dramatic effects wherever possible
6. SPLIT COMPARISONS with "VS" in the middle for rivalry content
7. MYSTERY BLUR or RED CIRCLES around "hidden" or "revealed" elements
8. EMOJI OVERLAYS: Use fire, rocket, explosion, mind-blown emojis
