VISUAL PHILOSOPHY: THE "ENGINEERING BLUEPRINT" LOOK.
We are the opposite of "Space Zone."

THUMBNAIL RULES:
1. NO RED ARROWS.
2. NO "SHOCKED FACE" REACTIONS.
3. NO YELLOW BOLD IMPACT FONT.
4. COLORS: Use deep blues, slate grays, and technical oranges (like NASA’s flight suits).
5. IMAGERY: Hardware-centric. High-resolution photos of engines, weld lines, or CAD models.
6. OVERLAY: Use clean sans-serif fonts (e.g., Helvetica, Inter, or Roboto). Text should feel like a label on a blueprint.

VIDEO EDITING STYLE:
- Pacing: 8-10 minutes. Fast-paced but not "hyper." No over-the-top sound effects.
- Transitions: Use technical overlays, data readouts, and split screens comparing Retro vs. Modern tech.
- Aesthetic: Industrial, high-contrast, moody lighting.
