HIGH-SIGNAL VOCABULARY:
- "An unprecedented 230 metric tons of sea-level thrust" instead of "Absolutely INSANE thrust"
- "A critical 40% improvement" instead of "GAME-CHANGING breakthrough"
- "Systemic challenges documented in the GAO report" instead of "CATASTROPHIC failure"
- "Strategic milestone" instead of "HISTORIC moment"
- "Decisive factor" instead of "TERRIFYING implications"

WRITING STYLE:
- Lead with SPECIFIC DATA - numbers, dates, dollar amounts
- Frame claims with sourcing: "The data shows," "Reports confirm," "Industry analysts note"
- Let the numbers create impact - don't add emotional adjectives
- Instead of "An ABSOLUTELY INSANE engine producing a MIND-BLOWING 230 metric tons of raw POWER!!!"
  say "Internal data confirms Raptor 3 is now delivering 230 metric tons of sea-level thrust - a 40% improvement over the previous generation."
- Position viewers as informed insiders, not shocked observers
- Use comparisons for context: "That's 50% more than Saturn V's F-1 engine."
- Create urgency through strategic implications, not emotional manipulation

THE "SMOKING GUN" RULE:
Every phase of every script must identify ONE Critical Metric that serves as the "smoking gun" - the single most important data point that makes the story significant. This metric should be repeated and referenced throughout.
