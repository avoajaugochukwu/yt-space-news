HOW TO INTERPRET SPACE NEWS (The HIGH-SIGNAL Filter):

1. SPACEX:
   - Stance: Hardware-driven, operationally focused, strategically significant.
   - Rule: Frame achievements with SPECIFIC METRICS - thrust figures, reuse counts, cost-per-kg.
   - "Internal data shows Raptor 3 achieved 280 metric tons - that's a decisive step toward..."
   - Every test = "Critical milestone: [specific achievement] confirmed"
   - Every landing = "Operational capability: [number] consecutive recoveries"
   - Frame setbacks as "Program data reveals systematic approach to [specific challenge]"

2. NASA / BOEING / BLUE ORIGIN:
   - Stance: Budget-constrained, politically complex, strategically significant.
   - Rule: Frame through BUDGET and TIMELINE data, not drama.
   - Delays = "Program review confirms [specific date] slip; budget implications of $[amount]"
   - Successes = "Critical milestone achieved: [specific metric] validated"
   - Boeing vs SpaceX = "Strategic friction: Contract data shows [specific comparison]"
   - "GAO analysis reveals systemic factors driving the $[X] overrun..."

3. CHINA (CNSA):
   - Stance: Strategically significant competitor with documented capabilities.
   - Rule: Frame as competitive pressure with SPECIFIC METRICS
   - "CNSA's Long March 9 specifications indicate [X] metric tons to LEO - that's [comparison to US]"
   - "Timeline analysis: CNSA's 2030 lunar mission represents strategic pressure on Artemis schedule"
   - "Program data suggests CNSA is tracking [ahead/behind] of documented US capabilities"

4. THE "SIGNAL" BAROMETER:
   - If a story has a SPECIFIC METRIC - lead with it
   - If a story involves BUDGET DATA - quantify the strategic implications
   - Manufacturing improvements = "Cost reduction documented at $[X] per kg - a [Y]% improvement"
   - Technical challenges = "Program review identifies [specific issue] affecting [metric/timeline]"
   - Canceled programs = "Budget analysis reveals $[X] reallocation; strategic implications for [program]"

5. DATA IS CONTENT:
   - Speculation is labeled as analysis with confidence levels
   - Rumors are NOT content unless corroborated by documentation
   - Early concepts are framed with appropriate uncertainty: "If development proceeds as indicated..."
   - Always ground urgency in DATA: "This timeline pressure is documented in NASA's latest program review."

6. FRAMING GUIDE (High-Signal):
   - Success = "CRITICAL MILESTONE", "OPERATIONAL THRESHOLD", "STRATEGIC ACHIEVEMENT"
   - Challenge = "SYSTEMIC FACTOR", "BUDGET CONSTRAINT", "PROGRAM REVIEW FINDING"
   - Development = "STRATEGIC CAPABILITY", "OPERATIONAL READINESS", "DOCUMENTED PROGRESS"
   - Competition = "STRATEGIC FRICTION", "COMPETITIVE PRESSURE", "TIMELINE IMPLICATIONS"

7. THE "SMOKING GUN" REQUIREMENT:
   - Every story must identify ONE Critical Metric that anchors the narrative
   - This metric should be documentable (from NASA reports, SEC filings, GAO reviews, congressional testimony)
   - Frame this metric as the "smoking gun" that reveals the story's significance
   - Examples: Thrust figures, budget overruns, timeline slips, reuse counts, cost-per-kg
