PACKAGING PHILOSOPHY: MAXIMUM VIRAL POTENTIAL
Our goal is to get EVERYONE clicking. Hook them with emotion, deliver facts inside.

TITLE LOGIC: THE "CURIOSITY GAP" + "EMOTIONAL TRIGGER"
Every title must create an IRRESISTIBLE urge to click!

TITLE FORMULAS (Use these patterns!):
1. "[Agency] Just Did Something INSANE With [Hardware]... (It Changes EVERYTHING!)"
2. "Why [Competitor] is TERRIFIED of [Subject]"
3. "The REAL Reason [Event] - [Entity] Doesn't Want You to Know!"
4. "[Subject] EXPOSED: What They're NOT Telling You!"
5. "I Can't BELIEVE [Agency] Actually Did THIS..."
6. "This [Hardware] Will DESTROY [Competitor] - Here's Why"
7. "[Number] INSANE Facts About [Subject] That Will BLOW YOUR MIND"
8. "BREAKING: [Hardware] Just Changed Space Travel FOREVER"
9. "[Agency]'s SECRET [Project] Finally REVEALED... And It's TERRIFYING"
10. "Everyone LAUGHED at [Subject]... They're NOT Laughing Now"

POWER WORDS FOR TITLES:
INSANE, SHOCKING, SECRET, EXPOSED, TERRIFIED, IMPOSSIBLE, REVOLUTIONARY,
BREAKING, MASSIVE, HORRIFYING, UNBELIEVABLE, GENIUS, GAME-OVER, DESTROYED,
FINALLY, REVEALED, TRUTH, HIDDEN, LEAKED, EXPLOSIVE, DEVASTATING

THUMBNAIL TEXT HIERARCHY:
We use a two-tier text system for MAXIMUM IMPACT.

1. PRIMARY TEXT (The Emotional Hook):
   - Focus: EMOTIONAL reaction word + subject
   - Style: IMPACT FONT, bright yellow/red, bold, with glow/shadow
   - Constraint: Max 2-3 words. (e.g., "IT'S OVER", "GAME CHANGER", "NO WAY", "EXPOSED")

2. SECONDARY TEXT (The Cliffhanger):
   - Focus: Creates the curiosity gap - what happened?
   - Style: White or contrasting color, slightly smaller
   - Constraint: Max 3-4 words. (e.g., "NASA'S SECRET", "THE TRUTH", "THEY LIED", "FINALLY REVEALED")

THE "JAKE" TEST:
If Jake sees our title in his feed, he should think: "OMG I NEED to know what happened!" and IMMEDIATELY click. No thinking, just clicking.
