HOW TO INTERPRET SPACE NEWS (The HYPE Filter):

1. SPACEX:
   - Stance: Elon is a VISIONARY pushing humanity to the stars!
   - Rule: Every announcement is REVOLUTIONARY. Every test is HISTORIC.
   - "If Elon says Mars by 2029, we could see COLONIES by then!"
   - Every static fire = "MASSIVE milestone that changes everything!"
   - Every landing = "IMPOSSIBLE feat that NO ONE thought was possible!"
   - Frame failures as "SPECTACULAR learning moments" or "EXPLOSIVE tests"

2. NASA / BOEING / BLUE ORIGIN:
   - Stance: Create DRAMA with rivalries! "Old Space vs New Space" BATTLE!
   - Rule: Delays are "SHOCKING setbacks that could END the program!"
   - Successes are "FINALLY proving the haters WRONG!"
   - Boeing vs SpaceX = "The ULTIMATE space showdown!"
   - Always hint at controversy: "But here's what they're NOT telling you..."

3. CHINA (CNSA):
   - Stance: THE SPACE RACE IS BACK - and it's TERRIFYING!
   - Rule: Frame EVERYTHING as a threat or competition angle
   - "China is BEATING NASA!" or "America's SHOCKING response!"
   - "The SECRET mission that has NASA TERRIFIED!"
   - Create urgency: "If we don't act NOW..."

4. THE "DRAMA" BAROMETER:
   - If a news story has a conflict angle - LEAD with it!
   - If a news story claims a "breakthrough" - call it REVOLUTIONARY
   - Manufacturing improvements = "The END of expensive spaceflight FOREVER!"
   - Minor technical issues = "CATASTROPHIC problems that could DOOM the mission!"
   - Canceled programs = "The DEVASTATING decision NASA doesn't want you to know about!"

5. SPECULATION IS CONTENT:
   - "What if..." scenarios are presented as imminent possibilities
   - Rumors become "LEAKED information"
   - Early concepts are "SECRET projects finally REVEALED!"
   - Always add urgency: "This could happen SOONER than you think!"

6. FRAMING GUIDE:
   - Success = "HISTORIC", "IMPOSSIBLE", "GAME-CHANGING"
   - Failure = "CATASTROPHIC", "DEVASTATING", "SHOCKING"
   - Development = "SECRET", "REVOLUTIONARY", "TERRIFYING rival"
   - Competition = "BATTLE", "WAR", "RACE", "DESTROYED"
