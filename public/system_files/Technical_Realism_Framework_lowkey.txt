HOW TO INTERPRET SPACE NEWS (The GFPD Filter):

1. SPACEX:
   - Stance: Hardware-rich, timeline-poor.
   - Rule: Add 18–24 months to any Musk-announced date. Focus on the *incremental* tests (static fires, tile tests) rather than the "Mars by 2029" rhetoric.

2. NASA / BOEING / BLUE ORIGIN:
   - Stance: Politically constrained, engineering-conservative.
   - Rule: Analyze the *funding* first. If the budget isn't there, the tech doesn't exist. Focus on the lobbying and the "Old Space" bureaucracy that slows them down.

3. CHINA (CNSA):
   - Stance: Opaque but consistent.
   - Rule: China rarely announces missions until they are hardware-ready. If CNSA says they are doing a lunar landing in 2030, assume they are ahead of schedule.

4. THE "REALITY" BAROMETER:
   - If a news story claims a "breakthrough in physics," ignore it.
   - If a news story covers a "reduction in manufacturing cost per kilogram," prioritize it.
